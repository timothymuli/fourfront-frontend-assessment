# Fourfront Frontend Assessment

This is a simple frontend page built using:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)

## Project folders
- `index.html` - main page
- `css/styles.css` - styling
- `js/app.js` - JavaScript
- `assets/` - images

## How to run (VS Code Live Server)
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Right click `index.html`
3. Click **Open with Live Server**

## What I implemented
- Responsive layout using Bootstrap grid (`container`, `row`, `col-*`)
- Membership sections that open/close using Bootstrap Collapse
- JavaScript:
  - Email validation (checks `@` and `.`)
  - Shows membership details after clicking **Send**
  - Changes the `+` to `−` when a membership opens

## Notes
- Image file names must match exactly (WSL/Linux is case sensitive).
- Bootstrap JS bundle is required for the collapse buttons to work.
